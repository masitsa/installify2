                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>We recommend using Appsflyer. It is free to attribute and track organic installs on Appsflyer. Set up links that uniquely identify your smartbanner on Appsflyer and then use this link in your smart banner setup.</p></div>

                        <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">info_outline</i>Can installify be user by marketers, who do not have technical or coding skills?</div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Yes. All of our setup is very easy and done within our webapp, you can change all the banner attributes and properties. After the banner is created you will be given a Javascript code which you will have to put in the header of the page's HTML page. This is literally just a copy and paste job so nothing scary there. If you do need to use tech time, it should take no more than 5 minutes. Once installed you will be able to change all the baner properties in your Installify account.</p></div>
